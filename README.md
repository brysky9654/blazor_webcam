# Blazor Webcam
This sample project was created to demonstrate how to activate a user's webcam using Blazor and JSInterop. The beauty of this approach is being able to then use your favorite C# libraries to process and manipulate the resulting image. This example uses the [ImageSharp](https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp) library to add a user-generated caption to an image grabbed from a user's webcam.

This project is accompanied by a blog post tutorial.
